        <p>&quot;...Imagine there is no countries</p><p>It&#039;s not hard to do</p><p>Nothing to kill or die for</p><p>And no religion tooImagine all the people</p><p>Living life in peace...&quot;</p><p> </p><p>I&#039;m the big fan of the &quot;Imagine&quot; song. It&#039;s one of the most well-written songs.</p><p> </p><p>I have passively looked for a place that is similar to the world described in the song. Today I think I find the place that is &quot;closest&quot; to that world, and that place is called Kellogg.</p><p> </p><p>Imagine where</p><p>People are nice, friendly, and down to earth</p><p>People are laid back and collaboratively compete</p><p>People don&#039;t care about how rich or big you or your family are</p><p>People don&#039;t care how expensive you dress or how good looking you are</p><p>People are willing to be friend no matter how proficient your English is or how common we are</p><p>People are opened to interact and learn with ones with different culture, different mindset</p><p>People are willing to help you overcome cultural and language barriers and succeed at school</p><p> </p><p>Living at Kellogg for six months and spending time with my kwest people, section people, and Brazil-trip people strengthen my belief that this is not imagination but it&#039;s the reality.</p><p> </p><p>Living life in happiness,I feel so lucky, privileged and grateful to live in this wonderful small world and to know you all my Kellogg friends</p><p> </p><p>March, 2014</p>
