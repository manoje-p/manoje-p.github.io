<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="hard-work-paid-off.html">My SEO lessons at TripAdvisor</a></h2>      
   <span class="subheadline">Posted on  October 7, 2014</span>
        <p>This past summer I got a great chance to intern with TripAdvisor’s SEO team where I got introduced to the world of SEO. SEO, Search Engine Optimization, is about how to drive unpaid traffic from search engines like google and bing and it’s a new science/art where theories, knowledge and tools are still dynamic. TripAdvisor’s SEO team is considered one of the most premier SEO teams in the world. I think it would be valuable to share what I learned from working with SEO rock stars here for three months.</p><p> </p><p>I never thought I would be working on SEO but after learning and working on it for a couple of months, I found it very useful and challenging.</p><p> </p><p>SEO is basically about making our site appear on search engine’s result page with as high ranking as possible for each keyword that targeted users search and it still remains a key traffic channel for most websites. People here see SEO as the combination of 4 key questions.</p><ul><li>What do we want google to test about our site? Title tag, meta tag, and content in the page will tell google what our site is about and what keywords we want to target</li></ul><ul><li>Why should google pay attention to our site? Number and quality of linking our site get will tell google if our site is worth exploring.</li></ul><ul><li>How is our site relevant to users? Rich, original, relevant content will tell google that our site is beneficial for users</li></ul><ul><li>How friendly is our site to google? Make a page that is easy and fast for google to crawl</li></ul><p> </p><p>There are 5 key areas we can do to optimize a site</p><p> </p><p><strong>1. Optimize HTML tags</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><ul><li>Do keyword research to identify top keywords for each page and keywords people use to search.</li><li>On-page factors (OPF) including title tag and meta tag is the most important SEO driver.</li></ul><p>      i) Title tag</p><p>           - Be keyword-driven. Put the most searched relevant keyword at the beginning. Put the entire, exact keyword. Try to add 2nd and 3rd important keywords into the title tag. Don’t go beyond 55 characters; otherwise google will create a title for your site.</p><p>           - Capitalize the first letter of each word to make it look noticeable on a search result page.</p><p>           - For some pages, make the title seasonal, responding to what people search for in each month. For example, people search for different things for a given location across seasons.</p><p>      ii) Meta tag</p><p>           - Be keyword driven as it will get bolded on a search result page when users type a keyword in google.</p><p>           - Ensure it is fit within two lines on google.</p><ul><li>Other tags</li></ul><p>      i) Open graph tags for Facebook and Twitter card tags should also be addressed. Now google puts more weight on social media. These tags will not only help give more details to google, but also help make more context show when people share on Facebook or Twitter</p><p>      ii) Alt tags should be optimized for image search.</p><p>      iii) Pagination and canonical tags can be used to avoid duplication of content. Google penalize pages with duplication of content as they want to give weight to page with original content. The example is a blog where people can see posts by month or by category. Using these tags would tell the search engine that which version is original and which one they should not take a look.</p><p> </p><p><strong>2. Optimize contents</strong></p><ul><li>Create pages with each targeting a specific top keyword.</li><li>Prioritize the position of content. Content at the top of the page counts more.</li><li>Try to add content to pages. Think about what content can be added to each section of a page. Adding the definition of a company, product industry, or page toward the end of the page is a good idea. These are content that is relevant to keywords and putting it at the end doesn’t disturb user experience.</li><li>Add unique content. Remove duplicated content. You can look at the content pages of competitors and then summarize it in your own language.</li><li>Make it in a bullet-point format if possible. This would help both search engines and users when they read a page</li><li>Update content regularly. Blog is a great tool.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>3. Optimize indexation/crawling</strong> (most technical part of SEO)</p><ul><li>Take a look at each of your page with the view without Java Script to see what google finds</li><li>Optimize XML and HTML sitemaps</li><li>Optimize robots.txt file</li><li>Enhance page speed load time</li><li>Expose content. Don’t use AJAX or Java Script to hide content from google.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>4. Optimize internal linking</strong></p><p> </p><ul><li>Identify and prioritize pages that you want to improve the ranking and add links (to these pages) on other pages of the site.</li><li>Don’t over do internal linking. Each page has a power to pass on. Having so many links on a page end up not helping the pages that you try to link to.</li><li>Add breadcrumb links. In addition to increasing the number of linking, breadcrumb links help google understand the structure of the site and add the link structure on a search engine result page.</li><li>Add footer links at the end of a page and/or navigational links where possible.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>5. Optimize external linking</strong></p><ul><li> Develop a sharing feature where people can share on Facebook, Twitter, or Google Plus</li><li>Be active on social media. Keep creating and sharing content people like</li><li>Identify relevant parties/people and identify type of content we might be able to obtain links. Develop unique content for each.</li><li>Avoid duplication of content.</li></ul><p>It definitely takes time to build a great SEO-friendly site and takes time to realize the result. But it’s definitely worth optimizing it.</p><p> </p><p>This is what I learned over the summer and I’m sure this dot would lead me to somewhere great in the near future. </p><p> </p><p>October, 2014</p>

   <span class="subheadline">Posted on  April 19, 2014</span>
        <p>This morning I woke up with tears and happiness.</p><p> </p><p>It’s unbelievable what’s happened to me yesterday. I can’t believe that I am able to overcome the barriers that seemed too huge to overcome and achieve what seemed too far away from me.</p><p> </p><p>Success after hard work is the most beautiful one. This success is the one I dedicated everything. I never have to work hard like the past four months to obtain what I want. I used to be a high achiever before coming to Kellogg. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This’s the first time in my life I feel I am an underdog. There were several times I walked home in winter and was not sure if teardrops came from inside or outside.While many have relevant background and speak English as a first language or very fluently, I don’t. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>While many worked hard for 4-6 weeks and got an offer by mid February, I worked hard and got all rejections.</p><p> </p><p>While many worked on selling ourselves and researching companies, in addition to these, I need to work on speaking with clarity and projecting confident in American culture. I spent over fifteen hours a week on correcting my language, pronunciation, and enunciation and changing the way I speak and express myself to look confident in American culture. I practiced speaking loud, speaking toward the front, rolling my tongue, and making clear sounds of every syllable. </p><p> </p><p>It’s not easy. It’s not comfortable. It’s painful. But I have to.</p><p> </p><p>While majority had a lot of fun in Spring, I couldn’t. I couldn’t party with my friends. I worked with a startup in Chicago once a week to gain experience and build profile while still working hard on recruiting, keeping networking, looking for jobs, writing countless emails and applications.</p><p> </p><p>What has kept me fight and be determined is my dream and goals. I always told myself that this is why I came to Kellogg and this is where I want to be after Kellogg. I can get it much easier if I decide to look for a job in Thailand. I just never give up.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Eventually I make it. I feel so glad and happy. It&#039;s the feeling that it&#039;s eventually done and things paid off. It&#039;s so true that what doesn&#039;t kill me makes me stronger. I have improved myself and grown up a lot over the past four months. I learn that no real big success is easy and it is just a question of whether I work hard enough./p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Special thanks to all my friends who have helped me for the past four months. I have relied on many friends’ helps so much. There are many things particularly language and confidence that I cannot work on my own. Without you guys, it’s impossible to overcome it. Thank you so much for your continuous help and support.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I will remember this time forever. Whenever I fail in the future, I will tell myself that I failed big before and I was still able to get back. Whenever I feel that I should give up, I will recall this time and ask myself if I work hard enough.</p><p> </p><p>Time to enjoy spring</p><p> </p><p>April, 2014</p>

        <p>&quot;...Imagine there is no countries</p><p>It&#039;s not hard to do</p><p>Nothing to kill or die for</p><p>And no religion tooImagine all the people</p><p>Living life in peace...&quot;</p><p> </p><p>I&#039;m the big fan of the &quot;Imagine&quot; song. It&#039;s one of the most well-written songs.</p><p> </p><p>I have passively looked for a place that is similar to the world described in the song. Today I think I find the place that is &quot;closest&quot; to that world, and that place is called Kellogg.</p><p> </p><p>Imagine where</p><p>People are nice, friendly, and down to earth</p><p>People are laid back and collaboratively compete</p><p>People don&#039;t care about how rich or big you or your family are</p><p>People don&#039;t care how expensive you dress or how good looking you are</p><p>People are willing to be friend no matter how proficient your English is or how common we are</p><p>People are opened to interact and learn with ones with different culture, different mindset</p><p>People are willing to help you overcome cultural and language barriers and succeed at school</p><p> </p><p>Living at Kellogg for six months and spending time with my kwest people, section people, and Brazil-trip people strengthen my belief that this is not imagination but it&#039;s the reality.</p><p> </p><p>Living life in happiness,I feel so lucky, privileged and grateful to live in this wonderful small world and to know you all my Kellogg friends</p><p> </p><p>March, 2014</p>
