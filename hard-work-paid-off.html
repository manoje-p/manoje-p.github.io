  <span>Posted on </span><span class="entry-date"> April 19, 2014</span>
        <p>This morning I woke up with tears and happiness.</p><p> </p><p>It’s unbelievable what’s happened to me yesterday. I can’t believe that I am able to overcome the barriers that seemed too huge to overcome and achieve what seemed too far away from me.</p><p> </p><p>Success after hard work is the most beautiful one. This success is the one I dedicated everything. I never have to work hard like the past four months to obtain what I want. I used to be a high achiever before coming to Kellogg. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This’s the first time in my life I feel I am an underdog. There were several times I walked home in winter and was not sure if teardrops came from inside or outside.While many have relevant background and speak English as a first language or very fluently, I don’t. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>While many worked hard for 4-6 weeks and got an offer by mid February, I worked hard and got all rejections.</p><p> </p><p>While many worked on selling ourselves and researching companies, in addition to these, I need to work on speaking with clarity and projecting confident in American culture. I spent over fifteen hours a week on correcting my language, pronunciation, and enunciation and changing the way I speak and express myself to look confident in American culture. I practiced speaking loud, speaking toward the front, rolling my tongue, and making clear sounds of every syllable. </p><p> </p><p>It’s not easy. It’s not comfortable. It’s painful. But I have to.</p><p> </p><p>While majority had a lot of fun in Spring, I couldn’t. I couldn’t party with my friends. I worked with a startup in Chicago once a week to gain experience and build profile while still working hard on recruiting, keeping networking, looking for jobs, writing countless emails and applications.</p><p> </p><p>What has kept me fight and be determined is my dream and goals. I always told myself that this is why I came to Kellogg and this is where I want to be after Kellogg. I can get it much easier if I decide to look for a job in Thailand. I just never give up.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Eventually I make it. I feel so glad and happy. It&#039;s the feeling that it&#039;s eventually done and things paid off. It&#039;s so true that what doesn&#039;t kill me makes me stronger. I have improved myself and grown up a lot over the past four months. I learn that no real big success is easy and it is just a question of whether I work hard enough./p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Special thanks to all my friends who have helped me for the past four months. I have relied on many friends’ helps so much. There are many things particularly language and confidence that I cannot work on my own. Without you guys, it’s impossible to overcome it. Thank you so much for your continuous help and support.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I will remember this time forever. Whenever I fail in the future, I will tell myself that I failed big before and I was still able to get back. Whenever I feel that I should give up, I will recall this time and ask myself if I work hard enough.</p><p> </p><p>Time to enjoy spring</p><p> </p><p>April, 2014</p>
